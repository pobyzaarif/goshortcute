# goshortcute
goshortcute is a Go library for shorthand or shortcut to do something. This library created to help someone who lazy to write some codes, passing variable (string to []byte vice versa), checking map key or value (especially me, who write php code with a thousand func included such as in_array(), base64_encode(), md5() and more).
New function will be added when i need to use it in my project and i want to share with public ðŸ˜‚ or you can contribute this project even create issue for new function that you want.

## Installation
go get -u github.com/pobyzaarif/goshortcute

## List of functions
- goshortcute.StringSliceContains
- goshortcute.StringtoBase64Decode
- goshortcute.StringtoBase64Encode
- goshortcute.StringtoMD5Hash

i thought the func name already represnted the functionality, so yaa i don't need to explain more ðŸ˜‚.
